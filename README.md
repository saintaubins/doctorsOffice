<!-- - [react architecture]() -->

There are over 6 React components, some which will include, homepage, footer, header/nav bar, add doctor, add patient, and a  reports page.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
- Deploy firbase API with full CRUD.
- Deploy react UI, with full CRUD compatability to the backend.
- Create links in the nav bar.
- Show a doctor, with patients in the search field.
- Create a page to display the patients visits details. 
- Use profesional fonts on my pages.

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE
- Very detailed styling, with nice colors.
- To make it mobile reactive.
- Add react hooks, and have signIn authentication.

<!-- #### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object -->
I found that putting in the patient, and doc id would have been eaisier to handle CRUD, if it were not auto generated by the DB
but if it were put in by the user, at the time of creation.
