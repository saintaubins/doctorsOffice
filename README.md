	- this is my initial thinking of how I want the site to work. The doctor will see the scheduled patients, and have notes and test results for that patient, medicine prescribed, and suggested follow ups.
<!-- - [react architecture]() -->

There will be over 6 React components, some which will include, homepage, footer, header/nav bar, add doctor, add patient, and a  reports page.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
- Deploy firbase API with full CRUD.
- Deploy react UI, with full CRUD compatability to the backend.
- Create links in the nav bar.
- Show a doctor, with patients in the search field.
- Create a page to display the patients visits details. 
- Use profesional fonts on my pages.

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE
- Very detailed styling, with nice colors.
- To make it mobile reactive.
- Add react hooks, and patient billing.
